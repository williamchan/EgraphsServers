	<p>An egraph is a direct line between you and your favorite star. Cut through the red tape and tell your star whatever you want. He’ll talk back to you. Your moment with him gets frozen in time through an egraph. Share it on your Facebook wall. Hang it on your bedroom wall. Do whatever you want<br />
