            Egraphs was founded in September 2011 with the goal of connecting stars and their fans on a deeper, more personal level. In July 2012, we launched <a href="https://www.egraphs.com">www.egraphs.com</a> and our first product, an egraph.  It's a shared moment between a star and fan that's captured forever - think of it as a next-generation autograph that includes both a personal handwritten note and voice message from the star to the fan. Egraphs are authenticated, shareable, enduring, and currently available from over 100 Major League Baseball players. We seek to change the way fans connect with their stars by building products with global potential. You can read about our launch in <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/fandom/post/_/id/7783/egraphs-are-the-autographs-of-the-future">this ESPN article</a>.
