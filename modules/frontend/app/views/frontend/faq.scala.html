          <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
          <h2>
            <a name="what-is"></a>What is an egraph?
          </h2>
          <p>
            An egraph is a shared moment between you and your star, captured forever. It is the next generation autograph. Your star will personally read this message on their iPad. Then, based on what you requested in your order, your star will create an authenticated written and audio message just for you. No two egraphs are alike. Each one looks and sounds different; your egraph was created just for you based on your original message to the star.
          </p>
					<h2>
            <a name="egraphs"></a>How does Egraphs bring the stars to you?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Weeks before stars appear on our site, we talk to them about joining Egraphs. Once the star is on board, we make sure they are set up with an iPad and the Egraphs iPad app. It’s through the technology of the iPad that we’re able to bring you any star from anywhere in the world at any time. We take the time to sign them up in person and then gather voiceprints and handwriting samples. These are used later on to verify that the star you contacted is the one writing and recording an egraph for you. No middle men. No generic signed photographs, just a one-of-a kind egraph made just for you.
          </p>
          <h2>
            <a name="create"></a>How exactly does a star create an egraph?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Once you purchase an egraph, the rest of the work is done by your star through an iPad app developed by Egraphs for this very purpose. When the star has some time to connect with their fans, they will open up the Egraphs app. The first thing they see is your message. That’s important –  this lets them know who you are and why you’re a fan. Then the star goes on to create the personalized written and voice message to you through their iPad. They use an iPad stylus to write their message and the iPad’s microphone to record an audio message.
          </p>
          <h2>
            <a name="message"></a>What message can I send a star?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Anything! Well ... just about anything. You can tell the star how big a fan you are. Or that you went to the same high school. Or that you’re going to see him play when he comes to your town. It’s up to you. The only thing we ask is that your message is respectful to the star, just as we expect the star to be respectful in the written and audio messages they create for you. If your message doesn’t pass, we’ll kick it back to you to revise before we send it on to the star. For the full Terms of Use, click here.

          <h2>
            <a name="how-many"></a>How many egraphs are available from my star?  What happens if they sell out?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Each star agrees to create a certain number of egraphs in a specified period of time. Because egraphs are a one-to-one customized experience, they can’t be rushed or mass produced. That’s why a star will only agree to create a certain number at a time. They want to do it right.

						This does mean that egraphs from a certain star can sell out. When that happens, you’ll need to wait until the star is able to sign another batch. The celebrities will set their own schedules for when and how many egraphs they can sign, so if your favorite star is sold out, be sure to check back again soon on our website or follow <a href="http://www.twitter.com/egraphs">@@Egraphs</a> or your star on Twitter.
          </p>
          <h2>
            <a name="how-long"></a>How long will it be before I get my egraph?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Stars agree to create egraphs for fans in a timely manner. When you purchase your egraph, you will be given a date you can expect your egraph to be delivered by. If we foresee any issues with a star finishing your egraph by this date, we will let you know as soon as possible.
          </p>
          <h2>
            <a name="gift"></a>Can I give an egraph as a gift to someone else?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Yes, an egraph makes a great gift for a friend or family member. When ordering your egraph, be sure that you select ‘Yes’ where it asks “Is this a gift?” You’ll then be able to enter in the name and email address of the person you’re giving it to. When the star creates the egraph, the recipient will receive an email with information on how to view the completed egraph.
          </p>
					<h2>
            <a name="child"></a>The site terms say you have to be 13 to use the site. So can I give a gift to a child?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Assuming you have the parent's permission you can submit the egraph order with the name of the child, but the email address of the parent. In this case the parent will own the egraph and manage the privacy. Egraphs will transfer the ownership free of charge when the child is old enough to use the site.

            <a name="new-stars"></a>How do I know when new stars are available on egraphs.com?
