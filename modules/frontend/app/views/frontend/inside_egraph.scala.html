                An egraph is an authenticated and personalized interaction between a player and fan.  The fan receives a written and audio message – along with a handpicked high quality image – that the fan can view and share online and offline.  The egraph includes:

              <h2>The Biometric Authentication Process</h2>
              <p>
                The first thing we do with any star is personally sit down with him to create his biometric footprint – a
                two-factor identification of his voice and signature profile. By doing this, we know that it’s him
                creating egraphs for fans, no matter where he is in the world. Getting a great biometric footprint used
                in verification is just as important for us as it is to you and the star because we’re obsessed about the
                quality and authenticity of the egraph you receive. Here’s how we create the biometric footprint:

              <h2>The biometric authentication process</h2>
              <p>
                The first thing we do with any player is personally sit down with them to create a biometric fingerprint– a two-factor identification of their voice and signature profile.  By doing this, we can verify that it’s that person creating egraphs for fans, no matter where they are in the world.
              </p>
							<p>
                Getting a thorough biometric fingerprint used in verification is of the upmost importance to us.  It’s the basis of the trust both fans and players have in the authenticity of egraphs.

                <h3>Voiceprint</h3>
                <p>
                  We collect audio samples from each player to create their voiceprint.  Our technology extracts pitch, tone, cadence and other voice patterns that get turned into mathematical representations and statistical models.  We store these representations in electronic format for use in authentication (see below).

                <h3>Written signature profile</h3>
                <p>
                  Like the voiceprint, we collect in-person samples of the player’s signature.  Our signature identification technology measures a person’s speed, rhythm, acceleration and movement when they sign their name on an iPad.  Similar to the voiceprint, these are stored as complex algorithms for use in authentication (see below).

                Authentication: When a celebrity creates an egraph, we test both the audio message and the written
                signature to verify it’s actually your star who created it. If the voice message and signature pass our
                tests, then the egraph immediately gets sent to you. If the voice message recording and the signature
                don’t match with the voiceprint and signature profile we captured during enrollment, we have someone
                from our Quality Assurance team look into the issue. If we’re not sure it’s your star, then we won’t
                pass the egraph to you. We will let you know immediately and refund your money while we look further
                into the matter. That is our commitment to you – because we cannot afford to lose your trust in the
                quality and authenticity of the product.
