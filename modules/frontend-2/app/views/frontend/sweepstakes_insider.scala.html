          <h2>6.	Prize Drawing</h2>
          <p>
            On or about November 15, 2012, the Sponsor will select potential winners in a random drawing from among all eligible entries received. The first name selected will be deemed the potential Grand Prize Winner.  The second through eleventh names will be deemed to be the potential First Prize Winners.  The odds of being selected as a winner of any prize depend on the number of entries received. The Sponsor will attempt to notify the potential winners via telephone, mail or email on or about November 16, 2012. If the potential winner cannot be contacted within five (5) days after the date of the first attempt to contact him/her, the Sponsor may select an alternate potential winner in his/her place at random from the remaining non-winning, eligible entries. Sponsor reserves the right not to select a winner and cancel the Sweepstakes if, in its sole discretion, it does not receive a sufficient number of eligible and qualified entries during the Sweepstakes Period.

If a potential winner cannot be contacted or fails to submit the Declaration within the required time period (if applicable), such potential winner forfeits prize. If the potential winner is at least 18 but still considered a minor in his/her jurisdiction of residence, Sponsor reserves the right to award the prize in the name of his/her parent or legal guardian, who will be required to sign the Declaration on the potential winner's behalf and fulfill any other requirements imposed on winner set forth herein. Potential winners must continue to comply with all terms and conditions of these Official Rules, and winning is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements.
