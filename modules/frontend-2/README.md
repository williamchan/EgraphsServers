Egraphs Frontend Module
=======================

The Egraphs frontend module provides all of the front-end scripting,
html, and css for our production website. It also contains a test application
with all the selenium and jasmine-bdd testcases of the front-end.

All the work you intend to use in production should happen in
`/app/views` for server side templates and `/public` for client-side
scripting and styling.

When you're ready to get hacking, you should open the test application
using `front-end-catalog/run-test-server.command` and access the site on the
port you specify at the prompt.
