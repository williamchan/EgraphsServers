This is Jordan Schroter's bootstrap-responsive project at GIT version 32802b66ec8a90487941b07a2110c6540bf32896.

We have made a few notable changes to the code that should persist should we choose to update this library:

* Changed $.fn.modal to $.fn.responsivemodal. This was necessary in order to stop a heisenbug
  that caused the original bootstrap $.fn.modal implementation to override this library's version.
* Added the class "responsive-modal" to a bunch of the css rules. This allowed us to specify
  a hard width for the modal if we want to, as in the case of the "review order" dialog in the
  gift certificate purchase flow.
